# DT_VoiceChat

## Purpose
Inspired by Star Trek and a YouTube Video by Part Time Larry (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si0vFx_dJ5Y&list=WL&index=18) I create a short python file which adds a voice frontend to ChatGPT. 

## Installation
1. Just clone the repo onto your computer. 

2. Before you can execute look into the import and download the modules with PIP. I might add a requirement.txt later, but until then you might be required to google the dependencies if some module is missing for you.

3. Create a file mygptkey.py with the following content:
def return_key():
    mykey = 'YOUR_KEY'
    return mykey
 
 Your ChatGPT key you need to get from the openai website. 

4. Execute the listener python file with "python3 listener.py".


I have tested the file only on MAC. I have not tried to use it on some other device.

Enjoy
